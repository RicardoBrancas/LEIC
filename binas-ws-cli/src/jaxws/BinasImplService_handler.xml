<handler-chains xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee">
    <!-- 
         A handler chain defines which handlers are called.
         
         The handlers are called in the order of declaration for outbound messages, and 
         in the reverse order for inbound messages.
         
         Individual handlers can be commented/uncommented to exclude/include them in the chain.
         
         Additional handlers can be added.
         
         The same handler can be specified multiple times, for example,
         to log the message at the beginning and at the end of the chain.
